\# NuttX Real-Time Operating System

\[\*\*NuttX\*\*\]\(http:\/\/nuttx.org\/\) is a real-time operating system \\(RTOS\\) with an emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's \\(such as VxWorks\\) are adopted for functionality not available under these standards, or for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded environments \\(such as fork\\(\\)\\).

NuttX was first released in 2007 by \[Gregory Nutt\]\(http:\/\/nuttx.org\/doku.php?id=wiki:developers:gregory\_nutt "wiki:developers:gregory\_nutt"\) under the permissive BSD license.
